                        <h3><span>Neural Networks</span></h3>
                        <div><span>Neural networks are a class of algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks, such as the human brain.</span></div>
                        <div><span>Key concepts include:</span></div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Artificial Neurons</em><span>: Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons or perceptrons. These neurons receive input, apply a mathematical operation, and produce an output signal.</span></li>
                            <li><span><em>Layers</em>:</span><span>&nbsp;Artificial neurons are organized into layers within a neural network. The input layer receives the input data, the output layer produces the final output, and there may be one or more hidden layers between them.</span></li>
                            <li><em>Weights and Biases</em><span>: Each connection between neurons in a neural network is assigned a weight, which determines the strength of the connection. Biases are additional values that allow neurons to adjust their outputs.</span></li>
                            <li><em>Activation Function</em><span>: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the neural network, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs.</span></li>
                            <li><em>Forward and Backward Propagation</em><span>: During forward propagation, the input data passes through the layers of the neural network, and the outputs are computed. Backward propagation involves updating the weights and biases by calculating gradients and propagating them backward through the network to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.</span></li>
